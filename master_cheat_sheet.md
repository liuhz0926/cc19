# Cheatsheets

Some groups of students have contributed to the community by writing the following cheat sheets.


## HTML, JavaScript, and D3

Yitao Liu (yl4343) and Yiyang Sun (ys3284)

In addition to the visualization tools we have learned using `R`, we would like to introduce another powerful visualization tool, `D3.js`. We created a [GitHub Page](https://tonyytliu.github.io/Stat5702_CC60/){target="_blank"} as well as the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tonyytliu/Stat5702_CC60){target="_blank"} to introduce basic knowledge of building a D3 visualization. We have made cheat sheets for [HTML](https://github.com/tonyytliu/Stat5702_CC60/blob/master/intro_to_html/Basic_HTML_Notes.pdf){target="_blank"}, [JavaScript](https://github.com/tonyytliu/Stat5702_CC60/blob/master/intro_to_js/Basic_JavaScript_Notes.pdf){target="_blank"} -- two cornerstones of coding with D3 library, and a cheat sheet for [D3.js](https://github.com/tonyytliu/Stat5702_CC60/blob/master/intro_to_d3/Basic_D3_Notes.pdf){target="_blank"}. 

To better help fellow students to kick-off with D3 visualization, we also provided code examples of [HTML](https://github.com/tonyytliu/Stat5702_CC60/blob/master/intro_to_html/html_examples.html){target="_blank"} and [D3](https://github.com/tonyytliu/Stat5702_CC60/blob/master/intro_to_d3/d3_example.html){target="_blank"} in our GitHub Repository.
