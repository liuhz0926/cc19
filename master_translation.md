Some groups of students have contributed to the community by translating useful resources into another language.


## Translation for R & ggplot2 visualization tutorials

Yuchen Pei and Jiaqi Tang

We translated two online tutorials for visualizaiton in R into Chinese. The first one is called [*A Comprehensive Guide to Data Visualization in R for Beginners*](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-data-visualisation-in-r-for-beginners-ef6d41a34174) and the second one is called [*ggplot2: Mastering the basics*](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2017-11-17-ggplot2_tutorial/). Our translation files can be found here: https://github.com/Jasmine1231/EDAV-19Fall-Community_Contribution .
