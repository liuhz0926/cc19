<p>This Rmd file is created by Chengyou Ju (UNI: cj2624) and Yujie Wang (UNI: yw3442) for STAT GR5702 Community Contribution Group 15.</p>
<p>In this file, we will provide a tutorial on how to draw Wordcloud graphs using the <code>wordcloud2</code> package in R.</p>
<p>The dataset in this project are from the <strong>demoFreq</strong> package.</p>
<div id="introduction-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> 1. Introduction</h2>
<p>A Wordcloud is a visual representation of text data. Wordclouds are useful for quickly perceiving the most prominent terms, which makes them widely used in media and well understood by the public.</p>
<p>A Wordcloud is a collection of words depicted in different sizes. The bigger and bolder the word appears, the greater frequency within a given text and the more important it is.</p>
<p>There are two packages in R that can help us draw a wordcloud. <code>wordcloud</code> is the basic package to build the graph, while <code>wordcloud2</code> package allows more customization. In our demo, we will focus on the <code>wordcloud2</code> package, which is more widely used.</p>
</div>
<div id="demo-of-wordcloud2-package" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.2</span> 2. Demo of <code>wordcloud2</code> Package</h2>
<p>For our demo, we will use a built-in dataset <code>demoFreq</code>, which has 1011 observations of 2 variables, words and frequancy.</p>

As we can see, the word cloud is easy to build and to read. Words with large frequency like ‘said’ and ‘oil’ are displayed in big font size.<br> It is actually an interactive plot. If we hover on a certain word, it will pop up the word with its frequency.</p>
